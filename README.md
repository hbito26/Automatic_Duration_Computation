# Automatic Duration Computation

This project uses 1-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs) to automatically compute the durations of earthquakes. The data used for training is the Pacific Northwest Seismic Dataset ([Ni et al., 2023](https://github.com/niyiyu/PNW-ML))

The repository includes notebooks for 
- 1. Inspecting and characterizing the waveforms
- 2. Creating the training datasets
- 3. Training the 1D CNNs
