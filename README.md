# Automatic Duration Computation

This project uses 1-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs) to automatically compute the durations of earthquakes. For training, the waveform data from the Pacific Northwest Seismic Dataset ([Ni et al., 2023](https://github.com/niyiyu/PNW-ML)) were used.

The repository includes notebooks for 
1. Inspecting and characterizing the waveforms
2. Creating the training datasets
3. Training the 1D CNNs
